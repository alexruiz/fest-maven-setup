Provides a custom JUnit 4.3.1 <code>Runner</code> that takes a screenshot of failed GUI tests executed, for example, in an
IDE.
</p>
<p>
The custom JUnit <code>Runner</code>, <code>{@link org.fest.swing.junit.v4_3_1.runner.GUITestRunner}</code>, can 
take screenshots of failed GUI tests. To use it, just annotate your test class with 
&quot;<code>@RunWith(GUITestRunner.class)</code>.&quot; Screenshots of failed tests will be saved in the directory 
&quot;failed-gui-tests&quot; (relative to the directory where tests are executed.)
</p>
<p>
<code>GUITestRunner</code> has been tested with Eclipse 3.4.1. It is currently not working with IntelliJ IDEA due to bug 
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/jira/browse/IDEA-13389" target="_blank">IDEA-13389</a>.
