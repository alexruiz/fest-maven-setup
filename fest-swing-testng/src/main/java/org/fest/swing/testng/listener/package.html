<a href="http://fest.easytesting.org/swing" target="_blank">FEST-Swing</a> can take screenshots of the desktop when a 
<a href="http://testng.org" target="_blank">TestNG</a> GUI test fails. Because of TestNG's excellent support for 
extensibility, this extension is very easy to configure.
</p>
<p>
The provided listener, <code>{@link org.fest.swing.testng.listener.ScreenshotOnFailureListener}</code>, takes a 
screenshot of the desktop when a test fails and saves it in TestNG's default output directory. Due to TestNG's flexible 
architecture, this listener can be called either from Ant, TestNG plug-in for Eclipse , command line, etc.)
</p>
To take screenshots of failed GUI tests, regardless of how they are executed, please follow these steps:
<ul>
   <li>Add the FEST TestNG Extension to your classpath (file fest-swing-testng-{VERSION}.jar, included when you 
   download FEST-Swing)</li>
   <li>Mark GUI tests (class or method level) with the annotation <code>org.fest.swing.annotation.GUITest</code></li>
</ul>
