Before starting to work on this project, execute the target "jar" target of the provided build.xml file. This target 
will compile all the JavaFX scripts and package them in javafx-scripts-classes.jar. This jar file is already in the 
classpath of the project. Repeat this process every time JavaFX scripts are added, updated or deleted.
