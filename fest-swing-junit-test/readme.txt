The purpose of this project is to test that the Ant-JUnit support in 'fest-swing-junit' works properly. So far, I 
haven't been able to automate this tests. For now, we have to run this tests manually and (manually) verify that the
JUnit HTML report has screenshots of the desktop for failed GUI tests.
